  What is the DOM?

  What are some node/document methods to find Nodes?

  What are the query selectors for:
  - class   => 
  - id      => 
  - body    => 
  - input   => 

  How you we make sure that the DOM is fully loaded before we add our JavaScript?
  
  What are Events?
  
  What are some types of events?

  How do we make sure that a <submit> btn doesn't reload the page?

  Synchronous vs asynchronous code?
